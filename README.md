Example tests for Rust

example_rstest.rs : Show example for setup using fixtures in rstest
example_setup_teardown: Example for setup and teardown code

Note: Currently, in rust we do not have an exact match library support for setup, and teardown in tests. So the example might be trivial.
But still hope this helpfully helps.
